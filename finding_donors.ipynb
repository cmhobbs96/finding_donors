    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Answer 2 - Model Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "- Can be used in email spam detection.\n",
    "- Strengths include being highly scalable, useful in text dataform, and time inexpensive.\n",
    "- Weaknesses include making an assumption of continuous data in the form of Gaussian distribution and it can become rather useless when the data is complex.\n",
    "- The Gaussian Naive Bayes method is a good candidate because the data in this project is relatively simple, continuous and used to categorize a person's income.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "- Used often in banking and e-commerce.\n",
    "- Strengths include high performance on low level interpretation.\n",
    "- Weaknesses include easily overfitting and you have to choose the number of trees.\n",
    "- The Random Forest Classifier method is a good candidate because of it's high performance given that this dataset does not have any data that needs interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) K-Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "- Used frequently in computer vision and facial recognition.\n",
    "- Strengths include being very simple, effective with large datasets, robust with noisy training data.\n",
    "- Weaknesses include need to determine K value and computation cost can be quite high.\n",
    "- The K Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a good candidate because the dataset in this project is quite large and shouldn't have too many outliers which will limit computational cost and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Used to predict outcome of a game between two teams.\n",
    "- Strengths include outputs being binary, the algorithm can be regularized to avoid overfitting, and it can be easily updated with new data.\n",
    "- Weaknesses include underperforming with non linear boundaries and complex data sets.\n",
    "- The Logistic Regression method is a good candidate because the income range is binary (>50k and <=50k) and with new data (new donors) the model can be updated easily.\n",

    "After reviewing the data and interpreting the graphs above, I believe that the Random Tree Classifier is the most appropriate model for CharityML given the task at hand. All three classifiers performed well in terms of accuracy and F-score, however the K Neighbors Classifier was too time expensive when training and testing the model. Also, the K Neighbors Classifier consistently performed the worst when training the testing subsets. Although the Logistic Regression model performed well when training the testing subsets, it did not perform nearly as well as the Random Tree Classifier model when training the training subsets. Finally, in the F-score on Testing Set graph above, it can be shown that the Logistic Regression model barely improves from 10% dataset to 100% dataset giving the impression that, with a large amount of data, this model would not be ideal. I think that all three models performed well enough to be suitable for the data at hand, but the Random Tree Classifier outperformed the rest of the models."

    "\n",
    "The Random Tree Classifier is an aggregation of multiple decision trees. At its most basic, a decision tree is made when making a binary decision, for example, a true/false question or a yes/no question. In statistics and machine learning, the probabilities of each outcome are used to determine the most likely decision. Although this can be highly prone to noise, the use of multiple trees or a 'forest' can enable a more accurate model. The Random Forest Classifier takes advantages of this accuracy and allows for subsets to overlap in different decision trees. As portrayed on Towards Data Science, \"For example, if you want to predict whether a person will click on an online advertisement, you could collect the ad’s the person clicked in the past and some features that describe his decision. If you put the features and labels into a decision tree, it will generate some rules. Then you can predict whether the advertisement will be clicked or not. In comparison, the Random Forest algorithm randomly selects observations and features to build several decision trees and then averages the results.\" This comparison shows the advantage of the Random Forest Classifier and how randomly selecting observations and features, i.e. overlapping subsets, can benifit the model. One more important note to make is the use of parameters and weights to fine tune the model. Just like when putting more weight on the outcome of a decision in life, the Random Forest Classifier can be tuned to give the most accurate and precise outcome.\n",
